# Element Session

DataJoint Element for Session Management. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize
and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments.  Each Element is
a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables
that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

Element Session features a DataJoint pipeline allowing for a standard approach to
session management. The Element is offers options for uniquely identifying sessions
either by...

- `session_with_datetime` - Recording date and time
- `session_with_id` - Numerical identifier
